This bug occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component with the `onBarCodeScanned` prop.  The prop is supposed to fire a callback function when a barcode is scanned. However, in certain cases, this callback never gets triggered, even if a barcode is successfully scanned. This is especially likely to happen when using the component within a complex layout or with other concurrently running processes that update the UI or access other system resources.  The behavior is inconsistent. Sometimes it works; other times, it silently fails.
